## Q: Cool site. Can I have one like this?

A: Yes!

[My old site](https://github.com/HenryFBP/henryFBP.github.io-old) was based on Jekyll, and I don't recommend it.

I am currently migrating it into Hugo, which this site is running on.

Clone <http://github.com/HenryFBP/henryFBP.github.io> and just edit it and reupload it to GitHub!

Alternatively, you can [fork it](https://github.com/HenryFBP/henryfbp.github.io/fork).

See [this link](https://www.wangchucheng.com/en/docs/hugo-eureka/getting-started/) and [this intro link](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) for more info.

## Q: Nice favicon. Where's it from?

A: Thanks! My good friend [@flexadecimal](https://github.com/flexadecimal/) made it. He is a very talented C programmer. Go give him free coffee and car parts.
